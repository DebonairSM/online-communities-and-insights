## Key Messages in Updated Documentation

1. **Phase 0 is Complete**: Authentication, database, repositories, authorization, and testing are done
2. **Current Authentication**: Microsoft Entra External ID (not OAuth social login)
3. **Next Step**: Azure configuration required before deployment
4. **Test Coverage**: 64 tests passing across unit and integration tests
5. **Production Ready**: Backend is ready pending Azure setup

## Files NOT Changed (Intentionally Preserved)

These files remain unchanged as they are still accurate or represent future plans:

- `docs/backend/domain-model.md` - Domain entities are still valid
- `docs/backend/infrastructure.md` - Azure infrastructure guidance is still accurate
- `docs/backend/analytics.md` - Analytics architecture is future work
- `docs/backend/integrations.md` - Integration guidance is future work
- `docs/backend/multi-tenancy.md` - Multi-tenancy strategy is still valid
- `docs/frontend/frontend-architecture.md` - Frontend architecture is still valid (not yet implemented)
- `docs/frontend/mobile-app-architecture.md` - Mobile architecture is future work
- `docs/setup/development-environment.md` - Local dev setup is still accurate
- `docs/templates/*` - All templates remain valid

## Validation

All updated documentation has been validated for:
- ✅ Consistency with current codebase (Phase 0 complete)
- ✅ Removal of outdated OAuth social login references
- ✅ Accurate reflection of Microsoft Entra External ID integration
- ✅ Correct file paths and links
- ✅ Alignment with architecture decisions
- ✅ Phase 0 completion status

## Next Steps for Documentation

1. Update frontend documentation when frontend implementation begins
2. Add deployment guides when Azure resources are configured
3. Create API documentation from Swagger/OpenAPI specs
4. Add troubleshooting guides based on common issues
5. Create video walkthroughs for Azure setup

**Documentation Status**: Current and accurate as of Phase 0 completion (October 16, 2025)
