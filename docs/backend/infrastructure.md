# Infrastructure & Deployment

## Hosting Strategy

**Azure App Service** for managed PaaS with auto-scaling and deployment slots.

### Environment Structure
- **Development**: Shared database, basic resources, auto-deploy on `develop` branch
- **QA/Test**: Separate database with sanitized data, load testing capability  
- **Staging**: Production-like infrastructure, deployed on `release/*` branches
- **Production**: Full infrastructure with geo-replication, 99.9% SLA

## Key Azure Services

**Compute**: Azure App Service (Premium V3 tier minimum)  
**Database**: Azure SQL Database with geo-replication  
**Cache**: Redis (Premium with clustering for production)  
**Storage**: Blob Storage for media, with CDN  
**Messaging**: Service Bus for event-driven architecture  
**Monitoring**: Application Insights with custom dashboards

## Deployment Pipeline

### CI/CD Flow
1. Code commit triggers build pipeline
2. Run tests and security scans
3. Build Docker images (if using containers)
4. Deploy to target environment
5. Run health checks and smoke tests
6. Blue-green deployment for zero downtime

### Infrastructure as Code
```yaml
# Azure Bicep templates for consistent deployments
resource appService 'Microsoft.Web/sites@2022-03-01' = {
  name: appName
  properties: {
    serverFarmId: appServicePlan.id
    httpsOnly: true
    siteConfig: {
      netFrameworkVersion: 'v9.0'
      alwaysOn: true
    }
  }
}
```

## Observability

**Logging**: Structured logging with Serilog to Application Insights  
**Metrics**: Custom business metrics and standard infrastructure metrics  
**Tracing**: Distributed tracing across services and external calls  
**Alerting**: Proactive alerts for error rates, performance degradation
