# Project Kickstart Document

## Product Vision

An Insight Community Platform modeled after C Space, enabling brands to conduct always-on, private research with their customers through insight communities. The platform seamlessly blends qualitative and quantitative research methods, supports digital ethnography (photo/video diaries, collaging), mobile-native participation, and human moderation. It delivers narrative-driven "Insight Stories" as the primary output, combining rich media, participant quotes, and statistical findings into client-ready deliverables. Built for research-first workflows, the platform ensures participant privacy, ethical consent management, and compliance with GDPR Article 9, HIPAA-lite, and SOC 2 requirements.
