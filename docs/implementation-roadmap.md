Based on your comprehensive context documentation, here are my recommendations for next steps, prioritized by value and dependencies:

## Immediate Next Steps (Week 1-2)

### 1. **Create Implementation Roadmap**
Define a phased delivery approach. I'd suggest:

**Phase 0 (Foundation)** - 2-3 weeks
- Development environment setup
- Azure infrastructure provisioning
- CI/CD pipelines
- Core authentication and tenant management

**Phase 1 (MVP)** - 6-8 weeks  
- Basic community management
- Simple engagement (posts, comments, reactions)
- User profiles and memberships
- Basic surveys (no advanced logic yet)

**Phase 2 (Research Tools)** - 8-10 weeks
- Qualitative tasks (photo/video diaries)
- Survey logic and branching
- Basic moderation queue
- Incentive tracking

**Phase 3 (Insights Workspace)** - 6-8 weeks
- Qualitative coding interface
- Theme management
- Quote library
- Basic insight story builder

**Phase 4 (Advanced Features)** - Ongoing
- IDIs and focus groups
- Mixed-method analytics
- Advanced integrations
- Mobile apps

### 2. **Create Project Structure and Scaffolding**
Set up the actual codebase:

```
online-communities-platform/
├── src/
│   ├── Api/                      # ASP.NET Core Web API
│   ├── Core/                     # Domain models, interfaces
│   │   ├── Entities/
│   │   ├── Events/
│   │   └── Interfaces/
│   ├── Application/              # Business logic, services
│   │   ├── Services/

│   │   └── Queries/

│   └── Web/                      # React frontend
│       ├── src/
│       │   ├── components/
│       │   ├── pages/
│       │   ├── services/
│       │   └── store/
├── tests/
│   ├── UnitTests/
│   ├── IntegrationTests/
│   └── E2ETests/
├── infra/                        # Bicep/Terraform IaC
│   ├── modules/
│   └── environments/
└── docs/
    └── contexts/                 # Your existing docs
```

### 3. **Define Database Schema First**
Start with the core entities from your domain model:
- Users & Authentication
- Tenants & Communities  
- Memberships
- Posts, Comments, Reactions
- Surveys & Questions

Create Entity Framework migrations for these foundational tables.

### 4. **Set Up Infrastructure**
Provision the Azure resources using IaC:
- Resource groups for dev/staging/prod
- Azure SQL Database
- Azure Storage (for media)
- Redis Cache
- Service Bus
- Application Insights
- Key Vault

### 5. **Establish Development Standards**
Create documents for:
- Coding standards and conventions
- Git workflow and branching strategy
- PR review process
- Testing requirements
- API design guidelines

## What I'd Prioritize First

If I were leading this project, here's what I'd tackle **this week**:

### Day 1-2: Project Kickoff Documents
Create these files in your repo:
- `README.md` - Project overview, setup instructions
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - How to contribute
- `docs/architecture/decisions/` - ADR (Architecture Decision Records) directory
- `docs/setup/development-environment.md` - Local setup guide

### Day 3-5: Initial Infrastructure
- Create Azure subscription and resource groups
- Set up Bicep templates for dev environment
- Provision basic infrastructure (SQL, Storage, App Service)
- Set up GitHub repository with branch protection
- Configure GitHub Actions for basic build/test

### Week 2: Core Foundation Code
- Initialize .NET solution with project structure
- Set up Entity Framework with initial entities (User, Tenant, Community)
- Create initial database migration
- Build authentication API endpoints
- Create React app with basic routing and auth flow
- Wire up Application Insights

## Key Decisions Made

Implementation decisions established:

1. **Team Composition**: Solo developer initially
2. **Timeline**: Flexible timeline for learning and iteration
3. **Technology Decisions**: 
   - ✅ Video hosting: **Azure Media Services**
   - ✅ Transcription: **Azure Cognitive Services**
   - ✅ Email: **Azure Communication Services**
   - ✅ Deployment Strategy: Start with **Azure App Service** (modular monolith)
   - ✅ Mobile App: Defer to **Phase 4** (web platform first)

See Architecture Decision Records for detailed rationale:
- [ADR-001: Clean Architecture](architecture/decisions/001-use-clean-architecture.md)
- [ADR-002: Azure Media Services for Video](architecture/decisions/002-azure-media-services.md)
- [ADR-003: Azure Communication Services for Email](architecture/decisions/003-azure-communication-services.md)
- [ADR-004: Azure Cognitive Services for Transcription](architecture/decisions/004-azure-cognitive-services.md)

## Document I'd Create Next

I'd create a `docs/implementation/phase-0-foundation.md` file that breaks down the foundation phase into specific tasks with acceptance criteria. Would you like me to draft that for you?

**My recommendation: Start with infrastructure setup and core authentication, then build vertically through one complete feature (e.g., basic community posts) to validate your architecture before expanding horizontally.**
