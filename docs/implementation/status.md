## Current Focus: Production Ready Authentication

The immediate priority is completing the authentication system for production deployment:

1. **Microsoft Entra External ID Configuration** âœ…
   - Token validation for Entra External ID JWT tokens
   - Claims extraction for tenant and role context
   - API Connector setup for token enrichment

2. **Database Foundation** âœ…
   - Entity Framework Core with ApplicationDbContext
   - Repository implementations for User and TenantMembership
   - Database connection and entity configurations

3. **Next Steps for Azure Setup**
   - Configure Microsoft Entra External ID tenant settings
   - Set up API Connector for claims enrichment
   - Configure Azure SQL Database connection
   - Test end-to-end authentication flow

## Phase Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Community (Months 1-3) - 0% Complete
- Multi-tenant community management
- Basic content creation and engagement
- User management and roles
- Simple moderation tools

### Phase 2: Research Tools (Months 4-6) - 0% Complete  
- Survey builder and response collection
- Poll creation and voting
- Basic analytics and reporting
- Mobile app foundation

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Months 7-12) - 0% Complete
- Qualitative research tools (video diaries, photo annotation)
- AI-powered insights and transcription
- Advanced analytics and insight stories
- Enterprise integrations

## Blockers & Risks

**Current Blockers**: None - foundation work progressing

**Risks**:
- Need to validate OAuth provider configurations in actual deployment
- Database multi-tenancy strategy needs finalization
- Dependency on Azure services for full feature set

## Recent Changes

**2025-01-15**: 
- **MAJOR CHANGE**: Migrated from OAuth 2.0 social login to Microsoft Entra External ID exclusively
- Removed all self-issued JWT token generation and OAuth callback endpoints
- Implemented Entra External ID token validation in Program.cs
- Created complete Entity Framework Core infrastructure with ApplicationDbContext
- Implemented UserRepository and TenantMembershipRepository with full database operations
- Added landing page endpoint and health check endpoints
- Configured dependency injection for all authentication services

## Next Steps

1. **Azure Configuration** (immediate priority):
   - Configure Microsoft Entra External ID tenant in Azure portal
   - Set up API Connector for token enrichment with tenant and role claims
   - Configure Azure SQL Database for production deployment

2. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Test authentication flow with actual Entra External ID tokens
   - Validate database migrations and entity relationships
   - Test authorization policies and multi-tenant security

3. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Update frontend to use Entra External ID authentication flow
   - Implement token storage and refresh logic
   - Create basic authenticated user interface
